## API documentation

## Overview

The API directory within the SummitShare platform's Next.js app plays a pivotal role in interfacing the client-side application with various backend functionalities. It routes requests to the appropriate handlers for actions such as user authentication, exhibit management, event operations, and more. This application uses the NextJs [app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
