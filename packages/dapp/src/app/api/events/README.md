## Creating an event

1. **Event Created and Stakeholders Added (Create Events API)**

   -  data required to send an event.`api/events/createEvent`

   ```json
   {
      "user_id": "1be3c37d-106c-49e0-9346-06ec291602a2",
      "proposal": {
         "event_type": "Physical",
         "event_name": "Sample Event",
         "event_category": "solo_exhibitions",
         "event_start_time": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
         "event_timezone": "UTC",
         "event_location": "Sample Location",
         "description": "A description of the event",
         "event_end_time": "2023-01-01T18:00:00Z",
         "cost": 50,
         "total_number_tickets": 100,
         "symbol": "SI"
      },
      "emailsArray": ["a@example.com", "b@example.com"]
   }
   ```

2. **Stakeholders Accept Requests sent to their registered emails**

   Stakeholders can accept requests by following the link in their mail.

   Users who are not verified will be redirected to a verification page and then to their dashboard.

   A verification page needs to be created for this .

3. **New Proposal Sent with Stakes for Added Stakeholders (Create New Proposal)**

       `api/events/proposals/CreateNewProposal`

   ```json
   {
      "event_id": "8669fb05-0151-4dab-90c0-a41aed2aaf96",
      "user_id": "1be3c37d-106c-49e0-9346-06ec291602a2",
      "proposal": {
         "event_type": "Physical",
         "event_name": "changed name",
         "event_category": "solo_exhibitions",
         "event_start_time": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
         "event_timezone": "UTC",
         "event_location": "Sample Location",
         "description": "A description of the event",
         "event_end_time": "2023-01-01T18:00:00Z",
         "cost": 50,
         "total_number_tickets": 100,
         "symbol": "SI"
      },
      "stakes": {
         "a@example.com": 50,
         "b@example.com": 50
      }
   }
   ```

   This is done once all users have accepted the invite to an event and stakes can be added

   -  Use the previous form, but stakes will be added instead of emails. Note that this uses a different API than the initial creation.

   -  Advise users to select Events > Proposals > Create New Proposal to reach the form to create a new proposal.

4. **Vote (Voting API)**

-  The creator of an event will not need to vote as they created the proposal.

-  To vote, send a user id, proposal id, and vote.

```json
{
   "proposal_id": "8d7148ad-c308-4623-964d-19e8675a200e",
   "Vote": true,
   "user_id": "63478ab8-537b-444e-9cb0-d34e14ce0fb6"
}
```

5. **Deployment**

-  Once all stakeholders have voted yes on a proposal the event is updated and the exhibit deployed
